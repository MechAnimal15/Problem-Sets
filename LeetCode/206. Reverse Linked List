## Problem #206: Reverse Linked List
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/submissions/1234196727

Overview:
Problem 206 tasks programmers with reversing a given linked list. Given the head of a singly linked list, the objective is to reverse the list's order, effectively transforming the original list from "1->2->3" to "3->2->1".

Approach:
The provided Python3 solution offers an efficient and concise approach to reversing a linked list. It iteratively traverses the list while adjusting the pointers of each node, effectively reversing the direction of the list's connections.

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        # Initialize previous node to None
        prev_node = None
        
        # Iterate through the linked list
        while head:
            # Store the next node temporarily
            next_node = head.next
            
            # Reverse the pointer of the current node to point to the previous node
            head.next = prev_node
            
            # Move the previous node pointer to the current node
            prev_node = head
            
            # Move the current node pointer to the next node
            head = next_node
        
        # Return the new head of the reversed linked list
        return prev_node
```

### Explanation:
This solution reverses a given linked list by iteratively adjusting the pointers of each node. It maintains two pointers: `prev_node` (initialized to None) and `head` (initially pointing to the head of the original list). 

### Key Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Begin by setting `prev_node` to None.
2. **Iteration**: Traverse through the linked list using a while loop until `head` becomes None.
3. **Pointer Reversal**: For each node, store its next node temporarily, reverse its pointer to point to `prev_node`, and move `prev_node` and `head` pointers accordingly.
4. **Return**: Once the loop ends, `prev_node` will point to the new head of the reversed list. Return it.

### Quality Assurances:
- **Clarity**: The solution employs straightforward pointer manipulation, enhancing code readability.
- **Efficiency**: The algorithm iterates through the linked list only once, ensuring optimal time complexity.
- **Robustness**: Test cases cover various scenarios, validating the correctness and reliability of the solution.

### Test Cases:
- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `1->2->3->4->5->NULL`
  - Output: `5->4->3->2->1->NULL`
- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `1->NULL`
  - Output: `1->NULL`
- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `NULL`
  - Output: `NULL`

### Conclusion:
Problem 206 underscores the significance of efficient pointer manipulation techniques in solving linked list problems. By implementing a clear and optimized solution, candidates showcase their proficiency in algorithmic problem-solving and demonstrate the ability to address fundamental data structure challenges effectively.
