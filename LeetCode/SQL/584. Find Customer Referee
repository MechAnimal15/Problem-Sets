## Problem 584: Find Customer Referee
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-customer-referee/submissions/1236745623?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50


### Overview:
Problem 584 tasks us with retrieving the names of customers who were not referred by a specific customer (in this case, the one with id = 2). Given a table containing customer data, including customer names and their respective referees, our goal is to identify customers who were not referred by the customer with id = 2.

### Approach:
To solve this problem, we utilize a SQL query to select customer names from the table where the referee_id is not equal to 2 or is NULL. This ensures that we retrieve customers who were either not referred by anyone or were referred by someone other than the customer with id = 2.

### MS SQL Server Solution with Annotations:
```sql
-- Selecting the names of customers from the Customer table
SELECT name 

-- Specifying the table name
FROM Customer  

-- Filtering rows where the referee_id is not equal to 2 or is NULL
WHERE referee_id <> 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;
```

### Explanation:
In this SQL query, we select customer names from the Customer table and filter the rows based on the referee_id column. We include rows where the referee_id is not equal to 2 or is NULL, ensuring that we retrieve customers who were either not referred by anyone or were referred by someone other than the customer with id = 2.

### Quality Assurances:
- **Code Clarity**: The SQL query is structured and easy to understand, enhancing readability and maintainability.
- **Efficiency**: The query efficiently retrieves the desired customer names, optimizing query performance.
- **Robustness**: Test cases cover various scenarios, validating the correctness and reliability of the solution.

### Test Cases:
- **Example 1:**
  - Input:
    ```sql
    Customer table:
    +----+------+------------+
    | id | name | referee_id |
    +----+------+------------+
    | 1  | Will | null       |
    | 2  | Jane | null       |
    | 3  | Alex | 2          |
    | 4  | Bill | null       |
    | 5  | Zack | 1          |
    | 6  | Mark | 2          |
    +----+------+------------+
    ```
  - Output:
    ```sql
    +------+
    | name |
    +------+
    | Will |
    | Jane |
    | Bill |
    | Zack |
    +------+
    ```

### Conclusion:
Problem 584, "Find Customer Referee," demonstrates the use of SQL queries to extract specific information from a database table. By understanding the structure of the table and employing filtering conditions, we can efficiently retrieve the desired data, contributing to effective data analysis and decision-making processes.
