## Problem #1757: Recyclable and Low Fat Products

### Overview:
Problem 1757 challenges candidates to write an SQL query to identify products that are both low fat and recyclable from a given table of products. The task involves querying a database table based on specific criteria and extracting relevant information.

### Approach:
I approached this problem by leveraging my SQL querying skills to filter the products table based on the `low_fats` and `recyclable` columns. I used logical operators to specify the conditions for identifying products that meet both criteria, ensuring an efficient and concise solution.

### Solution:
```sql
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
```

### Explanation:
- The SQL query selects the `product_id` from the `Products` table.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the rows based on two conditions: `low_fats = 'Y'` and `recyclable = 'Y'`, ensuring that only products meeting both criteria are included in the result.

### Quality Assurance:
- The SQL query is well-structured and adheres to best practices for readability and clarity.
- I ensured the query efficiently retrieves the required information without unnecessary complexity or redundancy.

### Test Cases:
To validate the solution's correctness, consider the following example:
- Input:
```sql
+-------------+----------+------------+
| product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
+-------------+----------+------------+
| 0           | Y        | N          |
| 1           | Y        | Y          |
| 2           | N        | Y          |
| 3           | Y        | Y          |
| 4           | N        | N          |
+-------------+----------+------------+
```
- Output:
```sql
+-------------+
| product_id  |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
```

### Conclusion:
Problem 1757 showcases my proficiency in SQL querying and data analysis, demonstrating my ability to solve real-world problems using database manipulation techniques. By efficiently identifying products that are both low fat and recyclable, I highlight my problem-solving skills and attention to detail.
