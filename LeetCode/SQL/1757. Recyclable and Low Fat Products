## Problem 1757: Recyclable and Low Fat Products
https://leetcode.com/problems/recyclable-and-low-fat-products/submissions/1235944878


### Overview:
Problem 1757 involves identifying products that are both recyclable and low fat based on certain criteria from a database. It requires writing a SQL query to extract the relevant information and filter the products accordingly.

### Approach:
To solve this problem, a SQL query is constructed to retrieve products meeting the specified criteria. The query involves accessing the `Products` table and filtering rows based on the values of the `low_fats` and `recyclable` columns.

### MS SQL Server Solution:
```sql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */

-- Selecting the product_id column from the Products table
SELECT product_id 

-- Specifying the table name
FROM Products  

-- Filtering rows where low_fats is 'Y' and recyclable is 'Y'
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';  
```
- `SELECT`: Specifies the columns to be included in the output.
- `FROM`: Specifies the table involved in the query.
- `WHERE`: Filters the results to include only products that are both recyclable and low fat.

### Explanation:
The SQL query retrieves the `product_id` from the `Products` table where the `low_fats` column is 'Y' (indicating low fat) and the `recyclable` column is 'Y' (indicating recyclable). By applying these filters, the query identifies products that meet both criteria simultaneously.

### Quality Assurances:
- **Clarity**: The SQL query is straightforward and easy to understand, enhancing readability and maintainability.
- **Efficiency**: The query ensures efficient retrieval of relevant information from the database.
- **Robustness**: The solution is robust and reliable, handling different scenarios effectively.

### Test Cases:
- **Example 1:**
  - Input: 
    ```
    Products table:
    +-------------+----------+------------+
    | product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
    +-------------+----------+------------+
    | 0           | Y        | N          |
    | 1           | Y        | Y          |
    | 2           | N        | Y          |
    | 3           | Y        | Y          |
    | 4           | N        | N          |
    +-------------+----------+------------+
    ```
  - Expected Output: 
    ```
    +-------------+
    | product_id  |
    +-------------+
    | 1           |
    | 3           |
    +-------------+
    ```

### Conclusion:
Problem 1757 demonstrates the application of SQL queries to filter and extract information from a database based on specific criteria. By crafting an optimized query, candidates showcase their proficiency in SQL and problem-solving skills, addressing real-world scenarios efficiently.
