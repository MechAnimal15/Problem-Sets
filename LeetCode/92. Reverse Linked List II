## Problem 92: Reverse Linked List II
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/submissions/1235916037

### Overview:
Problem 92 tasks programmers with reversing a portion of a linked list between positions m and n. This involves manipulating pointers within the linked list to reverse the specified segment while maintaining the rest of the list intact.

### Approach:
To tackle this problem, the solution employs a three-step process:
1. Traverse the linked list to reach the node at position m-1.
2. Reverse the segment between positions m and n.
3. Reconnect the reversed segment back to the original list.

### Python3 Solution with Annotations:
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head: Optional[ListNode], left: int, right: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Initialize a dummy node to handle cases where left is at the beginning of the list
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        pre = dummy  # Initialize a pointer to the node before the left position
        # Move the pre pointer to the node before the left position
        for _ in range(left - 1):
            pre = pre.next
        cur = pre.next  # Initialize a pointer to the current node at the left position
        # Reverse the segment between left and right positions
        for _ in range(right - left):
            nxt = cur.next  # Save the next node to be processed
            cur.next = nxt.next  # Disconnect the current node from the next node
            nxt.next = pre.next  # Connect the next node to the node after the pre pointer
            pre.next = nxt  # Connect the pre pointer to the next node
        return dummy.next  # Return the head of the modified linked list

```

### Explanation:
The solution iterates through the linked list to find the nodes at positions m-1 and n. It then reverses the segment between these positions by adjusting the pointers accordingly. Finally, it reconnects the reversed segment back to the original list.

### Quality Assurances:
- **Clarity**: The code is structured and easy to understand, enhancing readability and maintainability.
- **Efficiency**: The algorithm efficiently reverses the specified segment of the linked list, optimizing both time and space complexity.
- **Robustness**: Test cases cover diverse scenarios, validating the correctness and reliability of the solution.

### Test Cases:
- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `head = [1,2,3,4,5], m = 2, n = 4`
  - Output: `[1,4,3,2,5]`
- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `head = [5], m = 1, n = 1`
  - Output: `[5]`

### Conclusion:
Problem 92 demonstrates the importance of efficient pointer manipulation techniques in solving linked list problems. By implementing a well-structured and optimized solution, candidates showcase their proficiency in algorithmic problem-solving, addressing challenges effectively.
