## Problem 988: Smallest String Starting From Leaf

### Overview:
Problem 988, "Smallest String Starting From Leaf," tasks programmers with finding the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf node and ends at the root of a binary tree. Each node in the tree contains a value representing a lowercase letter ('a' to 'z'). The solution requires traversing the binary tree efficiently while constructing and comparing strings along the paths from leaf to root.

### Approach:
The solution employs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal technique to explore the binary tree structure. At each node, the algorithm accumulates the characters encountered along the path from the root to the current node, constructing potential candidate strings. By recursively traversing both left and right subtrees, the algorithm identifies the lexicographically smallest string among all possible paths from leaf to root.

class Solution:
    def smallestFromLeaf(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> str:
        # Helper function to perform Depth-First Search (DFS)
        def dfs(node, path, smallest):
            if not node:
                return
            
            # Append current node's character to the path
            path.append(chr(node.val + ord('a')))
            
            # If it's a leaf node, reverse the path and compare
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                current_string = ''.join(path[::-1])  # Reverse path to get string
                smallest[0] = min(smallest[0], current_string)
            
            # Recursively traverse left and right subtrees
            dfs(node.left, path, smallest)
            dfs(node.right, path, smallest)
            
            # Backtrack: remove the current node's character from the path
            path.pop()
        
        # Initialize smallest string as a large value
        smallest = [chr(ord('z') + 1)]  # Store smallest string found
        
        # Start DFS from the root with an empty path
        dfs(root, [], smallest)
        
        return smallest[0]

```

### Explanation:
This Python3 solution utilizes a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal approach to explore the binary tree efficiently. At each node, the algorithm appends the current node's character to the path and recursively traverses the left and right subtrees. Upon reaching a leaf node, the algorithm constructs the corresponding string by reversing the path and compares it with the current smallest string. The lexicographically smallest string among all leaf-to-root paths is determined and returned as the result.
