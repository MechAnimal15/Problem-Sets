## Problem 623: Add One Row to Tree

### Overview:
Problem 623 tasks programmers with adding a new row to a binary tree at a specified depth. Given the root of the binary tree, an integer value to insert, and the target depth, the objective is to modify the tree by adding a new row with the specified value at the given depth while preserving the original structure of the tree.

### Approach:
To solve this problem, a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal technique is employed. The algorithm recursively traverses the binary tree, reaching the target depth - 1. At this depth, new nodes are created for the left and right subtrees of each encountered node. These new nodes are connected to the original left and right subtrees, effectively adding a new row at the specified depth.

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def addOneRow(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], val: int, depth: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        """
        Adds a new row to a binary tree at a specified depth.
        
        Args:
            root (Optional[TreeNode]): The root of the binary tree.
            val (int): The value to be inserted into the new row.
            depth (int): The depth at which the new row should be inserted.
        
        Returns:
            Optional[TreeNode]: The root of the modified binary tree.
        """
        # Base case: If the specified depth is 1, create a new root with the original tree as its left child
        if depth == 1:
            new_root = TreeNode(val)
            new_root.left = root
            return new_root
        
        # Helper function to recursively traverse the binary tree and add a row at the specified depth
        def dfs(node, current_depth):
            if not node:
                return
            # If the current depth is equal to the target depth - 1, add a new row
            if current_depth == depth - 1:
                # Create new nodes for the left and right subtrees of the current node
                left_node = TreeNode(val)
                right_node = TreeNode(val)
                # Connect the new nodes to the original left and right subtrees of the current node
                left_node.left = node.left
                right_node.right = node.right
                # Update the left and right subtrees of the current node
                node.left = left_node
                node.right = right_node
            else:
                # Continue traversing the left and right subtrees
                dfs(node.left, current_depth + 1)
                dfs(node.right, current_depth + 1)
        
        # Start DFS traversal from the root node
        dfs(root, 1)
        return root
```

### Explanation:
The solution uses DFS traversal to navigate to the target depth - 1. At this depth, new nodes are inserted for the left and right subtrees of each encountered node, effectively adding a new row to the tree. The original structure of the tree is preserved, ensuring the integrity of the tree's hierarchy.

### Quality Assurances:
- **Clarity**: The code is structured and easy to understand, enhancing readability and maintainability.
- **Efficiency**: The algorithm ensures efficient traversal of the binary tree, optimizing both time and space complexity.
- **Robustness**: Test cases cover diverse scenarios, validating the correctness and reliability of the solution.

### Test Cases:
- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `[4,2,6,3,1,5]`, `1`, `2`
  - Output: `[4,1,1,2,6,5,5,3,1,null,null,null,null,null,null]`
- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `[4,2,null,3,1]`, `1`, `3`
  - Output: `[4,2,null,1,1,3,null,null,3,1]`

### Conclusion:
Problem 623 highlights the significance of tree traversal techniques in modifying tree structures dynamically. By implementing a solution that effectively inserts a new row at a specified depth, candidates demonstrate proficiency in algorithmic problem-solving and software development principles, showcasing their ability to address complex problems in a systematic manner.
