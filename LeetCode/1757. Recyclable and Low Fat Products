## Problem 1757: Recyclable and Low Fat Products
https://leetcode.com/problems/recyclable-and-low-fat-products/submissions/1235899069

### Overview:
Problem 1757 tasks you with identifying products that are both low fat and recyclable from a table named `Products`. The table contains three columns: `product_id`, `low_fats`, and `recyclable`. The `low_fats` column indicates whether a product is low fat (with values 'Y' or 'N'), and the `recyclable` column indicates whether a product is recyclable (also with values 'Y' or 'N'). The goal is to retrieve the `product_id` of items that meet both criteria.

### Python Solution:
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT product_id  -- Selecting the product_id column from the Products table
FROM Products  -- Specifying the table name
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';  -- Filtering rows where low_fats is 'Y' and recyclable is 'Y'

```

### Explanation:
This SQL query selects the `product_id` from the `Products` table where the `low_fats` column is 'Y' (indicating low fat) and the `recyclable` column is 'Y' (indicating recyclable). The result contains the IDs of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

### Test Cases:
- **Example 1:**
  - Input: 
    ```
    Products table:
    +-------------+----------+------------+
    | product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
    +-------------+----------+------------+
    | 0           | Y        | N          |
    | 1           | Y        | Y          |
    | 2           | N        | Y          |
    | 3           | Y        | Y          |
    | 4           | N        | N          |
    +-------------+----------+------------+
    ```
  - Output: 
    ```
    +-------------+
    | product_id  |
    +-------------+
    | 1           |
    | 3           |
    +-------------+
    ```
  - Explanation: Only products 1 and 3 are both low fat and recyclable.

### Conclusion:
Problem 1757 demonstrates how SQL queries can efficiently filter data based on multiple conditions, allowing for targeted analysis and retrieval of specific information from a database. By formulating a well-structured query, programmers can quickly identify and extract relevant data points, facilitating informed decision-making and analysis.
