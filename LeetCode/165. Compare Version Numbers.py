# **Portfolio Entry: Problem 165 - Compare Version Numbers**
# https://leetcode.com/problems/compare-version-numbers/submissions/1248292269?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-03

# **Problem Overview:**
# Problem 165 on LeetCode, "Compare Version Numbers," presents the task of comparing two version numbers represented as strings. The goal is to determine if one version is greater, lesser, or equal to the other version. Version numbers consist of one or more revisions separated by dots ('.'). Each revision is a numeric value and may contain leading zeros. The comparison of version numbers involves comparing their revisions in left-to-right order, treating missing revisions as 0.

# **Approach:**
# The approach to solving this problem involves splitting the version strings into lists of revisions and iterating through each revision to compare them numerically. We use integer conversion to facilitate numerical comparison, with missing revisions treated as 0. The algorithm iterates through both version strings simultaneously, comparing revisions at corresponding indices. If one version has more revisions than the other, the missing revisions are treated as 0 during comparison.

# **Python3 Solution:**

# ```python
class Solution:
    def compareVersion(self, version1: str, version2: str) -> int:
        # Split the version strings into lists of revisions.
        v1_revisions = version1.split('.')
        v2_revisions = version2.split('.')
        
        # Determine the maximum number of revisions between the two versions.
        max_revisions = max(len(v1_revisions), len(v2_revisions))
        
        # Iterate through the revisions of both versions.
        for i in range(max_revisions):
            # Convert each revision to an integer or default to 0 if missing.
            v1_revision = int(v1_revisions[i]) if i < len(v1_revisions) else 0
            v2_revision = int(v2_revisions[i]) if i < len(v2_revisions) else 0
            
            # Compare revisions numerically.
            if v1_revision < v2_revision:
                return -1  # Return -1 if version1 < version2.
            elif v1_revision > v2_revision:
                return 1   # Return 1 if version1 > version2.
        
        # If all revisions are equal, return 0, indicating that both versions are the same.
        return 0

# **Annotations and Best Practices:**
#     - **Function and Variable Naming:** Descriptive names such as `v1_revisions`, `v2_revisions`, `max_revisions`, and `v1_revision` enhance code readability by clearly indicating their purpose.
#     - **Comments and Documentation:** Inline comments explain the purpose of each code block and complex logic. Additionally, the docstring for the `compareVersion` method provides a concise description of its functionality, parameters, and return value.
#     - **Code Structure and Organization:** The code is logically organized, with related functions grouped within the `Solution` class. Proper indentation and whitespace usage improve readability.
#     - **Algorithm Explanation:** The algorithm iterates through the revisions of both versions, comparing them numerically. This approach is chosen for its simplicity and efficiency in handling version numbers of varying lengths.
#     - **Error Handling and Edge Cases:** The code gracefully handles edge cases such as missing revisions and invalid input by treating missing revisions as 0 and ensuring integer conversion.
#     - **Optimization and Performance:** The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the maximum number of revisions between the two versions. This efficient approach minimizes unnecessary comparisons.
#     - **Usage Examples and Test Cases:** Additional usage examples and test cases can be included to demonstrate the code's functionality and verify its correctness, promoting better understanding and collaboration among users.

# Overall, this Python3 solution for Problem 165 exemplifies best practices in technical writing and coding standards, offering a clear and concise approach to comparing version numbers.
